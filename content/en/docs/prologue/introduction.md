    "data": [{
            "name": "password",//name of database
            "mysql_data": "varchar(255)",//mysql database
            "sql_attribute": "NULL",//mysql sql_attribute 
            //if there is no sql_attribute then it is NOT NULL so you can skip it
            "datatype": "string"//for interface file
        }],
    "roles": {
        "read": ["admin"],//roles allow to read
